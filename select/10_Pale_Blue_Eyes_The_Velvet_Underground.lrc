[00:07.60] Sometimes I feel so happy
[00:13.32] Sometimes I feel so sad
[00:19.08] Sometimes I feel so happy
[00:23.14] But mostly, you just make me mad
[00:29.28] Baby, you just make me mad
[00:36.83] Linger on your pale blue eyes
[00:48.39] Linger on your pale blue eyes
[01:02.64] Thought of you as my mountaintop
[01:08.45] Thought of you as my peak
[01:14.29] Thought of you as everything
[01:19.11] I've had but couldn't keep
[01:24.83] I've had but couldn't keep
[01:32.05] Linger on your pale blue eyes
[01:43.61] Linger on your pale blue eyes
[01:57.01] If I could make the world as pure
[02:02.89] And strange as what I see
[02:08.77] I'd put you in the mirror
[02:14.32] I put in front of me
[02:20.21] I put in front of me
[02:27.46] Linger on your pale blue eyes
[02:39.20] Linger on your pale blue eyes
[03:48.07] Skip a life completely
[03:53.92] Stuff it in a cup
[03:59.47] She said money is like us in time
[04:04.46] It lies, but can't stand up
[04:10.52] Down for you is up
[04:17.81] Linger on your pale blue eyes
[04:29.16] Linger on your pale blue eyes
[04:43.24] It was good what we did yesterday
[04:48.79] And I'd do it once again
[04:54.89] The fact that you are married
[04:58.26] Only proves you're my best friend
[05:06.20] But it's truly, truly a sin
[05:12.73] Linger on your pale blue eyes
[05:24.54] Linger on your pale blue eyes
